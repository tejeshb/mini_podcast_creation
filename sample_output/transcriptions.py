I'm Rob Artigo back for the Tough Things First podcast. You probably remember me as the broadcast journalist at KGO 810 in San Francisco Bay Area. I am also a writer. Here with me is Ray Zinn, the longest serving CEO in Silicon Valley history. Hello, Ray. Hello there, Rob. How are you doing today? I'm doing well. And this is a special edition of the Tough Things First podcast. If you're listening, you can just check out toughthingsfirst.com and find this podcast. And right next to the intro, you can see a little link that says watch now or see the video, something like that. Check us out on video. Well, Ray, when I was a reporter in Reno, I got to know a guy named Kenny Gwynn. He was the governor of Nevada. He was also a very wealthy businessman. I was talking to him and I told him that I was looking at a possible job offer in Fresno. And he did this very, I remember this vividly, put his arm on my shoulder and he said, if it's a step up, take it. And I didn't take the job because it was really a step sideways. You know, Fresno to Reno is really kind of a step sideways, kind of, at least in radio, it's a step sideways. So I didn't take it. And I've always appreciated that advice because it changed it. It kept me on course for success in radio. So, Ray, for starters, let me just ask you, when do we know when it's the right time to make a good career move? Well, there are three reasons why we change jobs. One is, as you talked about, a step up to get a promotion, to get a more pay or, you know, some advancement reason. The second is because you don't like the job, you don't like the company, you don't like your boss. You know, there's a don't like problem. That's that's number two. And number three is, is you want to relocate. In other words, you want to stay instead of living in Fresno or Sacramento, you want to live in Chicago. So those are the three reasons. The advancement, don't like it's a don't like situation where you don't like the boss company. Maybe you don't like where you live either. So but anyway, then the third, of course, is that you want to change location. Sometimes it's because you want to be closer to family or because it's educationally, it's more advantageous to to be at a certain area because of the schools you want to attend. So those are the three reasons why you want to to change. I would imagine you want to relocate because of the weather sometimes. I mean, here in California, it's, you know, it's pretty hot. Let's bring in Zen of Zen three. It's one of your books as part of your Zen of Zen three is the third book in your series, Zen of Zen, which has a bunch of nice, short writings in it. And it's a it's an entire book that covers a bunch of different topics, but a lot of wisdom in there. And I check out the page, the bottom of page twenty five, excuse me. It says changing jobs can be both a benefit and a hindrance if you're considering changing employers, consider the following. And there's two. Points here on the next page, point one, don't be a chain job changer, changing jobs every couple of years is viewed negatively and also, number two, don't make a move unless the total compensation is at least 20 percent more than that you are currently more than you are currently making. It's easy for me to say race. So let's let's check out number one here. Tell me about being a chain job changer and you as an employer and a person who has hired a lot of people in your lifetime. Tell us how that negatively impacts a person's resume and their their potential employment with you. Well, looking at it from the employer's point of view, it's expensive to train a person. Also, there's an adjustment period where they have to get adjusted to the new job, the new area. And that's that's a distraction. So if you're a chain job changer, then that means that, you know, you're going to be an expensive employee because a company is going to have to spend a lot of time and money training. You know, they say, you know, don't in war, they don't kill your your enemy, wound him because it takes two to carry him off the field. So, you know, a chain job changer is like a wounded soldier. You know, it takes it takes people to to help bring him up on board, to train him, to get accustomed to the new software, the new, you know, just everything's new. And so a chain job changer, I know it's like Peter Piper picked to pick up whatever. Yeah, right. Like that, you know, it's hard to say chain job changer, but it's it's it's an expensive thing for for an employer. And it also probably more importantly, it shows you're not loyal. You know, companies like loyal employees. And so loyalty is an extremely important attribute for employees. We had the lowest turnover in our industry at Micrel, the company that I that I founded and and and ran for 37 years. And and the reason we were so efficient was because we hired steady employees, people who are solid, people who are not chaining chain job changers. So anyway, that's that's the key. The key is, you know, show your loyalty, show that you're you're willing to to to work with your supervisor or the company and because there'll be good times to be bad times. And so we like loyal employees. Well, number two here is a financial question. And you put a number on it, you say 20 percent, you say, make sure that if you're moving for more money, moving jobs for more money. Make sure that it's 20 percent more than you're currently making. Yes, because, again, you're, you know, moving for a small amount of money, unless, of course, you're you're you don't like your boss or, you know, you said don't like problem, don't like where you live. You know, moving for a small amount of money, it doesn't look good to an employer because it does go back to what I talked about earlier about your loyalty. So just just moving to be moving, moving straight across for the same amount of money is a warning shot to the to the employer that you could be a problem employee. So if you're going to move, make sure you move for quite a bit more money, at least 20 percent, because, again, you're probably not going to get a raise at your new company for at least a year. And unless you timed it right when you left your old company, you could be, you know, a year or two years before you get another wage increase. And so, you know, don't move for for just five or 10 percent, you know, make make it worthwhile. And that's why I put that 20 percent figure in there, because that's a more reasonable number if you're going to consider changing jobs. And there's some there's a risk in changing jobs for you as an individual, as an as an employee, because you may not, you know, be able to perform it at at at that level at the at what you need to get a bigger pay increase. And so you want to make sure that that you have enough, you know, change, pay change to to make it worthwhile for yourself. And there are other considerations. I mean, like you said, if you're going to move for to relocate for whatever reason, if you just want to maybe you want to live in Austin or you want to live somewhere in Montana or something like that, you you can really have to look at the expense of making that move and how much that will affect what the the number actually pencils out to be. Because if it's 20 percent more and you end up paying that into just moving expenses, then. You know, that's a balance of state taxes to worry about, you know, some states charge more income tax than other states, and so you've got to make sure you take that into consideration the cost of housing, you've got to make sure you take that into consideration and just cost of living in general. And so if you're going from, let's say, California to Montana, the cost of living is quite a bit less in Montana, so therefore you could take a flat pay pay increase because you're going to make it up in the cost of living. So, or if you're moving from Montana to California, then, you know, you got to look at a, you know, a significant cost of living increase, you know, it's like 15, 20 percent higher in California than it is in Montana, so you got to make sure that that you do cover that change in cost of living. Well, we'll wrap it up by talking about this. I just heard the other day or read the other day that Quiet Quitting 2.0 is coming back. And obviously, if this means that people have decided to change jobs just to change jobs. And I imagine that what you have heard about Quiet Quitting the first time didn't bode well for employees and it probably won't the next time. Exactly. So, you know, loyalty, dependability, responsibility, accountability, all those things are good attributes to have as an employee. And of course, if I'm talking to employers, you know, make sure the people you hire have those attributes of responsibility, accountability, dependability, loyalty, all those things that make go to make a good employee.

SUM_TRANSCRIPT = """The text is a transcript of the Tough Things First podcast featuring Ray Zinn, Silicon Valley's longest-serving CEO, and Rob Artigo, a broadcast journalist. The discussion revolves around career moves and job changes. Zinn identifies three main reasons for changing jobs: advancement, dissatisfaction with the current job or company, and relocation. He advises against frequent job changes, as it can be seen as disloyalty and can be costly for employers due to training and adjustment periods. Zinn also suggests that if one is considering a job change for financial reasons, the new job should offer at least a 20% increase in total compensation. Other factors to consider include cost of living, state taxes, and moving expenses. The podcast concludes with a warning against Quiet Quitting 2.0, a trend of employees changing jobs just for the sake of change."""
